This organization contains other DuckDuckGo open source repositories that are currently not on @duckduckgo. This is unofficial-- it is not an organization made by DuckDuckGo, but fully comprises of their official open source work.

If DuckDuckGo would like this taken down, please make an issue in this repository and confirm in some way that you are affiliated with them / an employee. I will honor such requests.
