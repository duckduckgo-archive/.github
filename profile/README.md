This is an UNOFFICIAL archive. It is not an organization made by DuckDuckGo, but fully comprises of their official open source work. In the event that any of their repositories are removed, it will be found here.

**NOTE:** This organization additionally contains other DuckDuckGo open source repositories that are currently not on [@duckduckgo](https://github.com/duckduckgo). More specifically, it contains private open source repositories on [@more-duckduckgo-org](https://github.com/more-duckduckgo-org) that have been made public in some way. If Duck Duck Go, Inc. would like these specific ones taken down, please make an issue in this repository and confirm in some way that you are affiliated with them / an employee.
